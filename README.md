# Three Act Structure

WIP project to allow easily dragging and dropping of scenes.

Scene structure will be opinionated and inspired by 'Save the Cat!'.

Each card will have a description and a target word count. Sections will have expected word count.

Will also have a system for importing/exporting JSON representations and rendering to Markdown.
